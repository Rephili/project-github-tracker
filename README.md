# GitHub Tracker

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

The assignment this week was to create a page that keeps track of the repositories that I have forked and worked on during the Technigo Bootcamp.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I started out by breaking down the project in smaller pieces and focused on fetching all the API:s. It was sometimes hard to understand where to place the different chunks of code and where to call the functions. This week my goal was to meet the basic requirements. If I had more time I would add some more information to the repos, for example display the commit messages and/or the comments from each pull request. I would also do some more styling in CSS.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
